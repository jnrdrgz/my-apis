# API of APIs
Yeah, I know, it sounds like a terrible idea, but I want to do some projects that require to steal some little amount of data from the internet, and I dont want to open a port in my server for an API with one endpoint.

Names and endpoints will be a mess between spanish and english until the API is finished.

## Projects
- Dictio: API of [WordsWorthToRemember](https://github.com/jnrdrgz/WordsWorthToRemember)
- Bondis: project in progress
